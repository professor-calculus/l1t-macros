# l1t-macros
I run the macros in interactive mode:
```bash
root -l -b -q macroname.cxx
```
I compared the run-time with a compilied version before with no significant difference. So for ease of use I've stuck with running them in interactive mode. The code probably won't even pass through the compiler without errors now

## Code layout
- `Event` contains classes to read in each event from the ntuples
    * `TL1DataClass.h` is a class for each tree in the ntuples
    * `TL1PrimitiveClass.h` allows access to all the relevant trees
    * `TL1EventClass.h` manipulates the information from the trees. Gets all the relevant variables such as level-1 quantities, recalculations of certain variables, selection criteria, ...
- `Plotting` is completely separate from `Event`. Contains the logic for plotting
    * `TL1Plots.h` is the base class for all the plots and contains virtual functions to initialise the plots, Fill the plots and save the plots as pdfs. Additional parameters label the dataset, output directory, pu binning, ...
    * `TL1*.h` for the other header files each represent a different plot type: PU weights, rates vs efficiency, rates, resolutions, turnons, xvsy scatter plots
    * `tdrstyle.C` sets the general style used throughout
- `Tests` contains test macros. Can be disregarded for now. Mainly for development purposes
- `Utilities` contains macros which are helpful but not necessarily required
    * `TL1DateTime.C` uses root's `TDatime.h` for the date in the format YearMonthDay to label output files
    * `TL1Progress.C` prints the progress bar by taking the current event and the total number of events
- In the main directory
    * `DefaultPlots.md` lists the default plots created from each `*.cxx` file (may not be true in the master, but all these plots can be made)
    * `generatePUWeights.cxx` generates a root-file containing the pu weights for MC samples. Weighted to an input data sample. Also makes a plot of the PU weights
    * `makeJetResolutions.cxx` creates plots of (L1-Offline)/Offline [for energy] or (L1-Offline) [for position] for jets
    * `makeJetTurnons.cxx` creates turnon plots for jets
    * `makeJetXvsY.cxx` creates a 2D scatter plots of variable X vs variable Y for jets
    * `makeRateEfficiency.cxx` creates a plot of the L1 Rate (calculated from `makeRates.cxx`) against the absolute efficiency (for a different sample)
    * `makeRates.cxx` creates a plot of the rate against L1 threshold
    * `makeResolutions.cxx` creates resolution plots for energy sums
    * `makeTurnons.cxx` creates turnon plots for energy sums
    * `makeXvsY.cxx` creates a 2D scatter plot of variable X vs. variable Y for energy sums

## How to get variables from the ntuples
1. Create an object (named `event` for example) of class `TL1EventClass` with a single input argument, a vector of strings representing the directories where the root-files are located
2. Call the `Next()` function of class `TL1EventClass`. This returns a boolean, true if there is a next event, false if not. Hence this can be placed in the argument of a while statement
3. If we want to access the sums tree from l1RecoJetTree we can get to this like so:
    ```C++
    event->GetPEvent()->fSums 
    ```
4. The names for the ntuple trees are in `Event/TL1PrimitiveEvent.h`. `GetPEvent()` returns a constant to an object of class `TL1PrimitiveEventClass`. The trees from `TL1PrimitiveEventClass` are public, so caution must be taken if creating an object of `TL1PrimitiveEventClass`
5. To get the level-1 upgrade tree parameters (since these are stored in arrays) they are accessed from `TL1EventClass` and are public (due to laziness), e.g. fL1Met, fL1EmuMetHF, ...

## General things to change

1. Change the sample (only Data is really implemented thus far)
2. Choose the trigger name and title (name is placed in file names and title is placed on plot titles - this is the naming convention used throughout)
3. Choose the run number, or make it a range, or something like "2016B\_v1"
4. Input the output directory in outDirBase
5. Select the pile-up bin splitting. This will generate the plots in the chosen pile-up bins (note that the plots inclusive of pile-up are still produced)
6. Change inDir to point at the directory that contains all root-files you want to run over. The code uses the wildcard "\*.root" in this directory to select the root-files
7. Change outDir to conform to how you want the output directory to look like. I like:
    ```bash
    ${OUTDIRBASE}/${DATE}_${SAMPLE}_${RUN}_${TRIGGER}/

        XvsY/

        XvsYJets/

        Resolutions/

        ResolutionsJets/

        Turnons/

        TurnonsJets/
    ```

## makeXvsY.cxx
The object xvsy is a vector of TL1XvsY objects. Each one represents a different type of xvsy plot. `xvsy.emplace_back(new TL1XvsY());` to create a new element in the vector, then set:

1. `SetXBins(bins)` where `bins` is a vector with the edges of the bins desired (I typically have functions that generate this vector)
2. `SetX(name,title)` where `name` and `title` are the respective x-name and x-title as strings
3. `SetYBins(bins)` to set the y binning (typically the same as the x binning)
4. `SetY(name,title)` to set the y-name and y-title
5. `SetOutName(name)` to set the output name for this plot, e.g. `triggerName+"_"+xName+"_vs_"+yName+"_"+requirements` where `requirements` is a string describing any requirements for this plot (e.g. barrel only)
6. `SetAddMark(mark)` adds a `mark` (some test) on the plot that can describe any requirements if desired (e.g. eta range selected)

Now repeat this for all plots desired. Further down in the code inside the event loop (`while( event->Next() )`) is the logic of filling the plots. After getting the pile-up start filling using `Fill(xval, yval, pu)` applying some requirements:

1. For XvsY I typically include a requirement of `xval>0.0` and `yval>0.0` to prevent the z-scale from screwing up
2. For the `xval` and `yval` these are obtained from `event->GetPEvent()` if they are found in the ntuples originally. If they are created in `TL1EventClass.h` (such as level-1 values) then they are acquired via `event`, e.g.
    ```C++
    double offlineMht = event->GetPEvent->fSums->mHt;
    double l1Mht = event->fL1Mht; 
    ```
3. There are a few flags in `TL1EventClass` (`event` is an object of this). For MET in SingleMuon I typically use:
    ```C++
    bool muonFilterFlag = event->fMuonFilterPassFlag;
    bool metFilterFlag = event->fMetFilterPassFlag;
    ```
4. If using a phi variable as x or y, I send it through the `FoldPhi(phi)` function to get it in the range of 0 to pi.
